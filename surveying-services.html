					<h2> Boundary Retracement Survey </h2>
					<p>
						A Boundary Retracement Survey is a procedure by which a Professional Land Surveyor establishes the corners of a parcel of land. A Boundary Retracement Survey is the interpretation of evidence. Surveyors often say “Monuments over Measurements.” This means that there is only so much room on the surface of the earth, everyone’s property must fit. Therefore, the bearings and distances that are indicated in your deed are only one part of the puzzle, and the evidence found in the field is yet another part of the puzzle.
						Once the survey is completed, the client will have every corner of their property either marked by a monument that was either found or set by the surveyor or the corner may be referenced by a monument nearby that was either found or set by the surveyor. A map of the survey, known as a plat, will be provided to the client, which will show all of the monuments, whether found or set, the bearings and distances between them, and all other pertinent information used to establish the corners of the subject parcel. The client also has the option of having their legal description rewritten by the surveyor, which can be placed on an updated deed.

					<h2> Lot Split Survey (Subdivison) </h2>
					<p>
						A lot split is the legal division of any lot into two or more lots. Lot Split Surveys can be categorized by a minor subdivsion or a major subdivsion, as defined by the county in which the subdivision is being performed. Almost all lot splits/subdivsions require governmental review and approval.

					<h2> ALTA Land Title Survey </h2>
					<p>
						A land title survey is made for the Title Company and/or Lender with the survey and location data needed for the issuing of title or mortgage insurance. For this purpose a map is drawn to “ALTA” specifications. "ALTA" stands for American Land Title Association. The client specifies the data to be shown on the survey by way of the checklist known as "Table A". ALTA Surveys are generally performed on commercial properties. An ALTA Land Title Survey is guaranteed to meet the requirements for an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey as detailed by the American Land Title Association, National Society of Professional Surveyors and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping.

					<h2> Elevation Certificate </h2>
					<p>
						An elevation certificate is a fundamental part of the National Flood Insurance Program. Property owners always reserve the right to purchase an elevation certificate for their property, which may potentially reduce their flood insurance premium. An elevation certificate documents the elevation of the lowest floor of your house or building relative to the ground. It is especially important if the structure was built in a high-risk flood zone. Before contacting a surveyor, call your municipal government and ask them if there is an elevation certificate on file for your property.

					<h2> Topographic Surveys </h2>
					<p>
						A Topographic survey is when all items (trees, light poles, catchbasins, water main valves, building corners, edges of asphalt, ground points, etc.) are horizontally and vertically located and then mapped in a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) program. The most common use for topographic surveys is for the design and planning of construction projects such as a water main replacement, a building addition, or for subsurface drainage in a farm field.

					<h2> Construction Staking </h2>
					<p>
						Construction Staking is performed after the project is designed, to guide the constructors in building the proposed features. An excellent example of where this would be required is the construction of a new road. First, the existing road and storm structures must first be removed. Then, the proposed storm structures are installed. Finally, the proposed curb is installed and the asphalt is put in place. Survey stakes enable the constructor to place all of the catch basins in the proper location and elevation so when the proposed curb is installed around the catch basins, everything works just as the designer intended.
